She uses AI and machine learning to analyze human non-verbal behavior, including facial expressions, body gestures, and affective states. Professor Pantic demonstrates how these techniques can benefit autistic children in interpreting facial expressions. She envisions AI enhancing human abilities in sight, hearing, and communication, but warns against corporate misuse of behavioral data. Professor Pantic's background includes studying mathematics in Belgrade, specializing in computer sciences in Delft, and currently working in London as a Professor of Affective and Behavioral Computing. She is also the Research Director of Samsung AI Research Centre in Cambridge.",

Dr. Longo discusses the increasing presence of Artificial Intelligence in our lives, highlighting conversational bots, autonomous machines, personalized medicine, predictive analytics, and facial recognition systems. He emphasizes the lack of interpretability and explainability in AI technologies, introducing Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) as a solution. Dr. Longo, an academic, scientist, and teaching hero, presents real-world examples to illustrate the importance of XAI in shaping human interaction with machines. This new paradigm aims to empower human intelligence with artificial intelligence, revolutionizing the way we perceive and engage with technology.",

Canca's work focuses on the ethics of technology and population-level bioethics with an interest in policy questions. Prior to founding the AI Ethics Lab, she worked at various prestigious institutions including the University of Hong Kong, Harvard Law School, and the World Health Organization. The talk was given at a TEDx event independently organized by a local community.",

Watkins addresses the challenge of discriminatory computational models in AI, focusing on systemic racism in high-stakes sectors like policing, employment, health, and financial lending. He questions the concept of \"fairness\" in the context of structural racism and urges developers and adopters to think more ethically about AI. Watkins is the Ernest A. Sharpe Centennial Professor at the University of Texas at Austin and the Founding Director of the Institute for Media Innovation. He is leading a team to address AI and systemic racism in a new six-year program funded by the University of Texas at Austin. The research aims to achieve racially equitable AI in critical domains like health and transportation, involving various stakeholders to create a more equitable AI future.",

Dentists traditionally rely on challenging tools like X-rays for diagnosis, but AI, specifically Videa Health's AI, has enabled dentists to identify over 30% more dental conditions. This technology boosts patient confidence in treatment recommendations and positions dentists as crucial players in overall healthcare.\n\nFlorian Hillen's background includes research at MIT and Harvard Business School, as well as founding digital health startups. He dropped out of a Harvard PhD program to establish VideaHealth, which focuses on AI for dental disease diagnosis and treatment planning. The talk emphasizes the potential of AI to revolutionize dentistry and improve health outcomes.",

The DiCarlo research team has been studying how the brain processes images to recognize objects and faces, and they are developing precise computer models based on this understanding. They envision a future where targeted visuals like images and movies can improve physical and mental health, offering non-invasive treatment options for mental health conditions. DiCarlo's research focuses on using computational methods to understand the brain's visual system and developing brain-machine interfaces to restore lost senses.

The discussion delves into a fundamental uncertainty principle of meaning that connects precision to complexity in AI, highlighting that power and precision in AI come at the expense of explainability. The talk explores how advancements like ChatGPT and Dall-E require close to trillion parameters, making explainability challenging. The speaker emphasizes that human-like intelligence does not necessarily require explainability, and instead, trust can be built over time through evolution. The challenge lies in subjecting new AI to rigorous tests of time, as we are advancing much faster than evolution did in creating human intelligence. This pivotal moment could be our greatest test of time yet.",
